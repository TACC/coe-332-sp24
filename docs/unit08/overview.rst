Unit 8: Asynchronous Programming
================================

In this unit, we will discuss *Asynchronous Programming*, a method for computer
programs (like our web apps) to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. We will
introduce the concepts of concurrency, queues, and messaging systems to achieve 
our goal of adding a "long running" job functionality to our Flask API projects.
We will also write a series of functions (the "Jobs API") to help us create,
manage, and process tasks submitted by users.
